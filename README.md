# odin_form
An HTML and CSS form

The plan is to create a usable HTML form that looks half decent.

Form is completed and on theme as the previous CSS project (Philosophy). Looks half decent, as foretold. Might add another half of decency later.
Used the same images and a PNGWing image for the Thinker.
